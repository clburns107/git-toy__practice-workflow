##If I had intro music what song would it be? Why?

Dreamer by Supertramp.  I fell in love with this song when I was 3 or 4. My dad would play it on his tape deck in the car on the way to daycare. It was the first song I ever fell in love with and the first time I remember thinking abstractly about what it would look like to "put your hands in your head".
